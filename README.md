Hyperparameter Tuning of Neural Networks

Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating hyperparameter tuning for optimizing neural networks. The goal is to improve model performance by systematically adjusting key parameters like learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and activation functions
